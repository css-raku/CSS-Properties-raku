0.4.1
   - Add measure() and units() methods. Allow for
     variable base units.
   - Add viewport-width and viewport-height attributes
   - Renamed method widths to measurements
0.4.0
   - Reintroduce '+' and '-' infix overloading for
     units calculations. '+css' and '-css' are
     still available as more explict and strongly
     typed operators.
   - Adding CSS::Properties::PageBox (WIP)
0.3.10
   - Minor adjustments for Rakudo 2018.11+ Bleed
0.3.9
   - Adjust to Rakudo 2018.06+, including unordered
     hash keys and rw proxy accessors
   - Added +css and -css as experimental infix operators
   - Minor refactors to ast and optimize methods
0.3.8
   - Rename module CSS::Declarations -> CSS::Properties
0.3.7
    - CSS::Declarations::measure replaces CSS::Declarations::Font::pt
    - Assigning Nil to a property now deletes it. 
0.3.6
    CSS::Declarations
    - Support Color object assignments, e.g.:
      $css.border-color = Color.new(0, 255, 0);
0.3.5
    CSS::Declarations
    - Fix over-zealous optimization:
      This: border:5pt solid; border-color:red green blue yellow;
      Was optimized to: border:5pt solid red green blue yellow;
      Which is a step too far. The optimize() method now leaves the
      above alone. The general rule is that a property with multiple
      terms won't be further optimized.
0.3.4
    CSS::Declarations::Font
    - Add fc-pattern method. a computed pattern for fontconfig matching
    - Fixed bug with processing a list of font families
0.3.3
    CSS::Declarations
    - Adjust for latest Color module; include Color::Conversion
0.3.2
    CSS::Declarations::Box
    - Add bounds checks top >= bottom, right >= left
    - Add `move` and `translate` methods
    - Saner `Array` rw accessor
0.3.1
    CSS::Declarations::Box
    - Replace .leading() method with .line-height()
0.3.0
    CSS::Declarations::Units
    - Remove default exports. Everything is now tagged. :pt, :pt,
      :em, :ex, etc.
    - Avoid implicit export of '+' and '-' operators.
    - Add :ops export tag, which exports '➕' and '➖' for
      addition and subtraction with units conversion.
0.2.1
    CSS::Declarations::Box:
    - Remove rendering-specific 'build-box' method
    - Add 'font-length' method
    - Removed $!width & $!height - now handled as TWEAK options
    CSS::Declarations::Units:
    - Add 'em', 'ex' and '%' postfix operators
0.2.0 Add CSS::Declarations::Box, CSS::Declarations::Font
0.1.2 - Add :declarations constructor option. to enable construction from
        CSS declarations AST node.
      - Allow inheritance from objects or style strings
0.1.1 Added `.optimize` method. For direct optimization of ASTs, without
      the need to create intermediate objects
0.1.0 Improved write optimizations
      For example now rewrites style: margin-top: 1pt; margin-right: 2pt;
      as "margin:1pt 2pt"
0.0.4 CSS::Declarations:
     - allow list assignment. E.g.: $css.new: :background-position<top left>;
       shortcut for: $css.new: :background-position("top left");
0.0.3 CSS::Declarations::Units
    - Use 'but' for role application, not global 'does'.
0.0.2
    - Warn, but otherwise ignore illegal assignments:
      $css.azimuth = 'over-yonder'; # has no affect
    - handle default dependencies:
      -- border-color defaults to color
      -- text-align is 'left' or 'right' depending on direction
      (See README.md Properties appendix)
